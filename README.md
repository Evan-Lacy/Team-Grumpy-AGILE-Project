# Team-Grumpy-AGILE-Project

## Synopsis
>
>This project is the effort of Team Grumpy to work in an AGILE environment, creating layout for a two-week sprint for a WebAPI project. We used Trello as a ticketing system for the project, Movie Rater, and used the linked Google Drive Doc to lay out our User Stories.
